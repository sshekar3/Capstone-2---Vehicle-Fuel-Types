# Capstone-2---Vehicle-Fuel-Types Project Proposal
Capstone 2 Project - Looking at correlation between vehicle fuel type ownership vs. personal income


**Problem statement:** 
Is there a correlation between personal income and changes in ownership of vehicles by fuel types (year over year) that can be used to predict future vehicle ownership? 


**Context**
Renewable energy fuel vehicles have increased in popularity over the years. Are there higher rates of adoption in certain zip codes that correlates with average income? This analysis could help car manufacturers/dealerships better predict demand for different fuel type cars by area. This could also help companies who provide alternative fuel predict demand by area. 


**Criteria for success**
Establishing whether or not there is a clear correlation between personal income and ownership of vehicles by fuel type. 

 **Scope of solution space**
Comparing registration of vehicles in California from 2019 -2022 by zip code to personal income data by zip code. 

**Constraints**
Data is only for California from 2019 - 2022 and may or may not be extrapolated for other states in the US
Data does not track specific individuals and how their personal income compares to their choice of vehicle fuel type
Could be many other confounding variables (geography/weather, prices of vehicles)

**Stakeholders** 
CA Department of Motor Vehicles
Vehicle Manufacturers
Vehicle Dealerships
Fuel Vendors

**Data sources**

CA vehicle fuel type by zip code

CA income by zip code

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ca-educational-attainment-personal-income


**Project Method**
Combine DMV data for different years 
Clean DMV data 
Combine personal income data
Clean personal income data
Combine personal income and DMV data
Group by vehicle type, year, zip code to see relation between vehicle percentage vs. income
Plot relevant data
